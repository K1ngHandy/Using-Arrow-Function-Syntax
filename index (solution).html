    DIRECTIONS: Below are solutions to all the practice problems for this learning objective.  You can try each solution by copying it into your "index.html" file and clicking "Run". 
    */

    /* 
    PROBLEM 1: Write an arrow function "sayHello" that prints "hello" to the console
    */
    const sayHello = () => {
      console.log('hello');
    }

    /* 
    PROBLEM 2: write an arrow function "echo" that receives a string as an argument and returns it
    */
    const echo = (sound) => {
      return sound;
    }

    /* 
    PROBLEM 3: Write an arrow function "getSum" that receives two numbers as arguments and returns their sum
    */
    const getSum = (a, b) => {
      return a + b;
    }

    /* 
    PROBLEM 4: Write an inline arrow function "singSong" that receives a string as an argument and returns '...singing' + song
      e.g singSong('Happy') should return ...singing Happy
    */
    const singSong = (song) => `...singing ${song}`;

    /* 
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): Find and fix all the issues with the code below
    Fixes: 
      - Wrap the parameters for matchAnnouncement in parenthesis
      - Define the function matchAnnouncement before the function playGame is run. Read about how hoisting works in Javascript.
    */

    const matchAnnouncement = (player1, player2) => { /* Parenthesis are compulsory when there are more than one parameters */
      return `Welcome! Today, ${player1} faces ${player2}`;
    }

    const playGame = (player1, player2) => {
      console.log(matchAnnouncement(player1, player2));
      const winner = coinFlip(player1, player2);
      console.log('The winner is... ' + winner);
    }

    playGame('Phoebe', 'Rachel');

    function coinFlip(heads, tails) {
      if (Math.random() >= 0.5) {
        return heads;
      } else {
        return tails;
      }
